# Evaluating effects of agriculture on Population Trends of a Grassland Breeding Shorebird

Widespread agricultural intensification across North America has raised concerns about its impact on breeding bird populations. While the negative effects of intensification on population trends, species abundance, and avian biodiversity are well-documented, there are limited data quantifying these effects on breeding grassland shorebirds. During the breeding season, Upland Sandpiper (Bartramia longicauda) are widely distributed across North America and inhabit a range of agricultural landscapes, making them a useful species for understanding these effects. Landscape level factors such as composition, configuration, and diversity of breeding landscapes are suspected to play a role in their population trends and breeding distribution. Therefore, the objective of our study is to understand the overall influence of agricultural land use, and it’s change over time, on local trends in abundance of breeding Upland Sandpiper. To quantify breeding population dynamics, we used the large-scale, spatially explicit eBird Status and Trends dataset (2011–2022) combined with 11 years of land cover data, to characterize Upland Sandpiper breeding areas across North America. Trends in relative abundance during the breeding season (May to June) were modeled as a function of changes in landscape composition and configuration and results will contribute to a broader understanding of how large-scale landscape changes shape breeding trends in grassland-dependent birds.
